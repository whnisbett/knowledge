# Decoupling
- Decoupling refers to a shift in the power-to-heart-rate relationship as a workout goes on
- Tendency is for power:heart rate ratio to decrease as the workout goes on i.e. your heart needs to beat faster for your muscles to produce the same power
- Decoupling often quantified as power:heart rate ratio in the first half of workout divided by the ratio in the second half of the workout
$$
\delta = \frac{
	\frac{P_{H1}}{HR_{H1}}
}{
	\frac{P_{H2}}{HR_{H2}}
}
$$
## Causes of decoupling
- The basic assumption is that the same workload requires same amount of oxygen, which is consistently delivered by the same number of heart beats. But this is not always the case. Some things physiologically change as the workout goes on.
- **Supply side issues:** Stroke volume can decrease due to dehydration â€“ decreased stroke volume --> need faster heartbeat to deliver same amount of oxygen
- **Demand side issues:** As muscle fibers are damaged during a workout, the body recruits larger, less efficient muscles that require more O2 to exert a given power.
	- Type II muscle fibers require ~2x the O2 for a given power output
- Besides muscle damage, **the shift to less efficient muscle fibers also occurs when fibers run out of glycogen stores**
